# Employee Exit Automation

## Problem Statement
When an employee leaves the company (on their Last Working Day, or LWD), the HR team currently has to manually email all system stakeholders to deactivate the employeeâ€™s access to various systems. This process:
- Requires significant manual effort.
- Is prone to human error (e.g., forgetting to deactivate a system).
- Involves delays in ensuring complete access revocation.

## Solution Overview
The goal is to automate this process using a **Master API** that handles the deactivation of employees from various systems when their Active Directory (AD) profile is deactivated.

## Master API Workflow
1. **Trigger**: The Master API is activated when an employeeâ€™s AD profile is turned off.
2. **Deactivation Process**:
   - The API calls the deactivation APIs of all relevant systems asynchronously.
   - If a systemâ€™s API fails, it retries 2 times before marking it as failed.
3. **Email Notification**:
   - Sends an email to the HR and IT teams along with the employeeâ€™s reporting manager (if applicable).
   - The email contains a detailed status report of the deactivation process.
4. **Report Generation**:
   - A summary table is created showing the deactivation status for each system.

### Example Report Table:
| Employee ID | System      | Status      |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| UGLXXXX     | SkaleUp     | Deactivated |
| UGLXXXX     | GroXstream  | NA          |
| UGLXXXX     | Jayam       | Error       |

### Sample Email Format:
```
Subject: Exit Data/Exit Clearance - March 03, 2025  
Dear Team,  
Please find the exits and their status for today:

[Table with status details]

Thanks and Regards,  
Team UGRO
```

## Session Management Enhancement
### Problem:
Even after AD deactivation (e.g., at 7:30 PM), an employee who is already logged into a system (e.g., at 7:25 PM) can continue using it until they manually log out.

### Solution:
1. **Option A**: Implement session expiration where a new access token is generated every 30 minutes. If AD is off, the system denies the token, logging out the user.
2. **Option B**: When the Master API deactivates an employee, it forces all active sessions to terminate immediately.

## Integration Requirements for Individual Systems
Each system needs modifications to integrate with the Master API and enhance session management:

| System        | Required Updates                                |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| SkaleUp      | Implement session management & deactivation API |
| GroXstream   | Build a wrapper API for deactivation            |
| Jayam        | Develop admin-based API with session handling   |
| Easebuzz     | Obtain API from third-party provider            |
| Nach         | Develop a wrapper API & implement session control |
| Partner Portal | Build wrapper API for deactivation            |
| IT GOV       | Investigate feasibility of wrapper API          |
| DMS          | Develop API for deactivation & session handling  |
| SCF          | Create API to update status & manage sessions  |
| GRO PROTECT  | Develop API for deactivation & session control |

## Key Benefits
âœ… Eliminates manual email-based deactivation.  
âœ… Reduces errors through automation.  
âœ… Ensures employees are logged out immediately post-AD deactivation.  
âœ… Generates detailed reports for HR and IT tracking.  

## Technical Implementation
### API Call Example (JSON Payload):
```json
{
  "employeeId": "UGLXXXX",
  "email": "employee@company.com",
  "deactivationDate": "2025-03-06T18:00:00Z"
}
```

### Expected API Response:
```json
{
  "status": "Success",
  "details": [
    { "system": "SkaleUp", "status": "Deactivated" },
    { "system": "GroXstream", "status": "NA" },
    { "system": "Jayam", "status": "Error" }
  ]
}
```

## Deployment Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YourRepo/EmployeeExitAutomation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd EmployeeExitAutomation
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
5. Verify the API by testing an employee deactivation request.
